# Saydle
Saydle is a fun project which I built to give a twist to normal Wordle. We normally use our keyboard to type the letters and guess the word, right? In this game, we can't type. In fact, there is no keyboard. Instead, you have to use your voice to speak the words rather than typing.

# Tools and Technologies ⚙️
- HTML/CSS/Javascript
- Hasura (GraphQL)
- Sawo (Authentication)
- Heroku Postgres (Database)
- Deepgram (AI speech-to-text)
- Replit (deploy)

# Features 🤩
- No keyboard means that you can't see which characters you have already used on the on-screen keyboard. Though, you can see the grid to make out the unused letters.
- Also, there is no Enter or Delete key concept in this game. That means, as soon as you speak a 5 letter word, it is automatically submitted 😈.
- It uses passwordless authentication to authenticate users and maintain a history of the number of matches played and the number of matches won against each user.
